# C Projects Repository

Welcome to my C Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of projects I've worked on using the C programming language. Each project has its own directory, and you can find more information about each project in its respective README file.

## Getting Started
***Note:*** All the projects require CS50 library.

If you're interested in any of the projects, you can navigate to the project's directory and find detailed instructions on how to compile and run the code.
